While serving as team captain and conducting the Windows log analysis and report writing personally, our group earned a first-place finish and was awarded extra credit for our originality and thoroughness. 

The project was organized into three days: 
Day 1: Logs were provided for baseline analysis, report, and alert creation.
Day 2: A second set of logs was provided for post-compromise analysis.
Day 3: Group presentation.

Key Takeaways: 
  The reporting and alerts that we created on Day 1 would have detected the attack early, allowing timely response, and potentially prevented the ultimate exfiltration of data. 
  We were able to identify the methods and tactics used from the initial compromise, enumeration, privilege escalation, creating persistence, and exfiltration of data.
  An assessment of the overall security was made, and recommendations were made to help mitigate future compromises.
